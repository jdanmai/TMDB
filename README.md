TMDB data analysis

This is a Python project done on Jupyter notebook to analyze the Movie Database (TMDB).
In this data analysis, we will be looking at information about 10K movies from the Movie Database (TMDb). We are looking at which genres were most popular from year to year and exploring the relationship between the popularity of a film and it's vote average score

We will be going through data wrangling and exploratory data analysis.

We will answer 2 research questions:
1) What genres were most popular over the years?
2) Does the Popularity of a movie correlate with the Vote Score Average?
